## Rules

The game is played with 81 cards, each card showing a pattern of three features:

- Shape: Diamond, Oval, or Squiggle
- Color: Red, Green, or Purple
- Shading: Solid, Striped, or Outlined
- Number: One, Two, or Three

A Setâ„¢ is a group of three cards across which it is the case that each of these four features is either the same or different across the three cards.

## Development

When running in development mode (`npm run dev`), a debug menu is available that provides helpful testing features:
- Generate boards with no valid sets (after claiming one obvious one)
- Highlight an available sets on the current board
